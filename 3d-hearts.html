                <h3>UI Designer | Front End Developer</h3>
            </br>
                <i>In an independent study unit, myself alongside two talented colleagues, Andrew Le and Viswajith Unnikrishnan, designed and developed an interactive online learning module for the education team at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead.</i>

                <h2>Brief</h2>
                <p>
                    The brief asked us to produce a digital experience that enables medical students to independently learn about heart pathologies in small children. The interaction would be used alongside 3D printed heart models to facilitate guided case explorations, with the intent of keeping students engaged in learning about such anomalies.
                </p>

                <h2>Problem Space</h2>
                <p>Learning about the use context, we found that medical students in this class would watch a decades old video which demonstrates how to identify defects in infant hearts. Students then passed around waxed cadaveric hearts and were encouraged to explore the specimens by poking them with a pipe cleaner.</p>
                <p>Students felt that the lessons were quite tedious. With a lack of guidance they were confused and often lost interest in the area of Paediatric Cardiology.</p>

                </figure>
            </br>
                <p>Spending time looking into this existing classroom experience helped us identify the main pain points to address:</p>

                            <h3>A lack of resources</h3>
                            <p>Scarce supply of waxed cadaveric hearts, were also deteriorating with age.  Rural students did not have access to these resources at all.</p>

                            <h3>Limited learning content</h3>
                            <p>Outdated material made the lesson seem tedious, while students had limited time with paediatric cardiologists to ask questions and solidify their understanding.</p>

                            <h3>Unstructured explorations</h3>
                            <p>A hands-on approach with the heart models was valuable, but unguided exploration made the experience confusing and ineffective.</p>
                        </article>

                <h2>Research into Precedents</h2>
                <p>Research into existing interactive anatomy learning platforms gave us a better understanding of details that were considered important in the medical context.</p>
                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>Our method of ideation was centred around brainstorming the various kinds of features we could implement to enhance the experience of the module, as well as how to place them on the appropriate screens optimally to avoid detracting from main case content itself. As we were informed that four different cases needed to be completed within a 30-minute block, the efficiency and fluidity of the user experience became even more crucial factors in its design. </p>
                <h3>Userflow</h3>
                <p>Structurally, the lesson plans were straightforward and needed to be delivered as organised by the education team at the Children’s Hospital. I constructed initial drafts of the user-flow to plan out the progression of case information, and determine what features and content were appropriate in each frame, whether it be the menu or during interaction with the digital model.</p>

                <!-- INSERT IMAGE OF USERFLOW -->
                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <p>I then turned these paths into wireframes to display the important elements on each screen. This step was iterative, with basic interface versions sketched on paper then constantly refined as the wireframes were brought into the digital space with Figma. We each brought our versions of wireframes together and selected frames that we thought delivered the content best for its context of use.</p>
                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>With the underlying structures established, we passed the wireframes on to <a>Viswajith</a>, who designed the visual component of the interface. They style and layout were further iterated upon at this step as well.</p>
                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>Meanwhile, I began to code basic click-throughs using development technologies HTML, CSS and JS. The click-throughs I developed utilized JavaScript functionality to ensure the structure remained reusable and dynamic, as content would later be made editable in a CMS for those delivering the content. My colleague Andrew set up a server using Node.js to run the application locally, as well as the CMS through storyblok. 
                </p></br>
                <p>Andrew and I also learnt elements of the <a class="external-link" href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> library, which would allow the digital heart models to be placed in our web application for interaction. 
                    Our initial investigations of existing three.js projects led to us adding features such as a model splice function with dat.gui controls and orbit controls for panning and zooming, enabling students freedom to explore the defective heart anatomy.
                    </p>
                <h2>Feedback and Changes</h2>
                <p>After taking a functional, low-fidelity prototype to the education team with some of these proposed features, we realised many were not actually helpful from a medical standpoint. Features we initially valued, such as splicing were removed. </p>
                <h2>Final Product</h2>
                <p>Overall, the final interaction comprises of four cases with three sections in each – case details, exploration, and explanation. 'Case Details' and 'Explanation' sections are simple click-throughs, where students read and progress through information at their own pace. The main 'Exploration' section is where students can progress through instructive steps with an automatically orienting digital heart model to use as a point of reference while exploring the 3D printed model in their hands.</p>

                <h3>Main Features:</h3>
                <p>We designed the digital model to orient to the correct viewpoint with only relevant labels visible, so students can focus on the important details.</p>

                </figure>    
                
                <p>We integrated side access to case details so students can revisit vitals and other information as though they were really diagnosing a child. </p>

                <p>'Exploration' instructions are collapsible, and labels can be toggled on or off, so students can view the necessary information. </p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <h3>Feedback is so valuable</h3>
                <p>Our supervisors encouraged us to arange meetings with representatives from the education team to ensure that what we were developing was in-line with what they had in mind. Our initial ideas for features seemed valuable in our perspective even after the research phase, but this was not necessarily so in the eyes of the medical experts. </p>
                <h3>Make the most of your strengths</h3>
                <p>All three of us working on this project are design students, doing the same degree. However, we all had different strengths in different fields of design. I found this to be extremely valuable because this meant we had a broad reach as a team.</p>
