                <h4>Brief</h4>
                <p>
                    In an exclusive independent study unit, myself alongside two talented colleagues were presented with a design brief by the education team at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital at Westmead. 
                    The brief called for us to design an experience that would enable medical students to independently explore rare cases of heart pathologies in small children. 
                    To be successful, our design needed to facilitate self-driven learning and revision, encouraging students to be interested and aware of congenital heart disease instances amongst infants, while ensuring they felt comfortable exploring these anomalies.

                <h4>Problem Space</h4>
                <p>In the first few weeks, we dissected the brief, seeking constant clarification from the Westmead Team.
                    We discovered that medical students in this certain class would watch an outdated video which demonstrated how to identify a defect in infant hearts. Students then passed around waxed cadaveric hearts and were encouraged to independently discover defects by poking the specimens with a pipe cleaner. 
                    This information regarding the existing classroom experience helped us pinpoint the main problems to address. Two key concerns emerged from our findings:
