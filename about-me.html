                <h1>A bit about me...</h1>
                    <q class="user-q" style="font-size: 20px; font-style:italic; color: #999999; margin: 1em 0;">I’ve always been known as a jack of all trades but had no clue what the ‘one’ I wanted to master would be.</q>


                    <p>Like many, I was confused about my future for the longest time. There were many things that I liked, but didn't love, things I was good at, but not great at.</p>
                    <p>Until, in high school, I found joy in furniture design. I felt satisfaction in working on a piece I thought up myself, balancing my technical knowledge and a desire to explore creatively.</p>
                    <p>From here, I knew I wanted a future where I could exercise my sensibilities and logic, while letting my sense of creativity shine through.<p>

                    <p><strong>So I entered the Bachelor of Design Computing – now a UX/UI designer in training, looking to graduate by the end of 2021.</strong></p>
               
                    <p><strong>My area of specialisation lies in UI design and front-end development,</strong> where I am constantly honing my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I find great fulfilment working throughout the design process, from user-research, to the ‘light-bulb’ moments and implementing a final product.</p>
                    <q class="user-q" style="font-size: 20px; font-style:italic; color: #999999; margin: 1em 0;">Doing this degree opened my eyes to the power of design thinking in inspiring positive change and how designers can help address the wicked problems in our world.</q>

                    <p>As seen in my case studies, I enjoy myself the most, and excel when working on essential projects which seek to improve the lives of others.

                    My time in the UX world so far has been challenging, granted, but knowing that I save people from subpar experiences, inspires me to be here for the long haul.</p>
