                <h1>Collaborate to Donate<span class="date">JUNE '20</span></h1>
                <h3>Researcher | UX Designer | Product Designer</h3>
            </br>
            <i>In an independent study unit, myself alongside two talented colleagues, Andrew Le and Viswajith Unnikrishnan, designed and developed an interactive online learning module for the education team at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead.</i>

            <h2>Brief</h2>
            <p>The devastating bushfire crisis of 2019 – 2020 was met with a compelling philanthropic effort, as Australians around the country donated what they had to support the recovery of victims. Though given with good intentions, charities were overwhelmed by many unsolicited donations which hampered, rather than helped the recovery effort.</p>
        </br>
            <p>Based on this situation, and for all recovery efforts in times of crises, IBM ix posed a question asking, <strong>“How can we empower citizens to make a productive impact in times of need from useful donations that don’t become a burden to our response teams?”</strong></p>
            
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>With such a broad brief, we conducted primary research to gain insight into both charity and donor perspectives for the situation at hand. This involved interviews with representatives from both community initiatives and charity organisations, as well as sensitising and context mapping sessions with donors.</p>
            
            <h2>Problem Space</h2>
            <p>From the research we had gathered, we found that donors were keen to support those in need, especially in times of crisis. However, many also expressed an underlying distrust for how charities handle donations, feeling their donations were not supporting those most in need.</p>
        </br>
            <p>Charities in turn found many of the physical donations were not helpful, and only hampered their ability to give support to victims being limited in manpower and storage space.</p>
        </br>
            <p>In line with these findings, we decided to address a lack of transparency in charity efforts and build trust in the very organisations that seek to support those in their times of need.</p>

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>Our brief called for an experience that considers both digital and spatial elements. We designed several experience concepts, storyboarding a scenario of how we perceived it to pan out. With a Pugh Selection Matrix, we whittled down our options to one, and enhanced the concept to meet the overarching brief, and our specialised brief. A part of the development process involved adding features we thought were important, taking some ideas from the discarded designs as well as removing superficial elements.</p>
        
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Overall, the experience we chose to refine is Collaborate to Donate. With Leap Motion Sensing technology, users freely engage in the interaction with natural hand gestures, dragging and dropping donation items into a collection box for a fictional victim persona. The addition of the persona attempts to enhance the connection with positive change that donors felt they lacked when they chose to donate. Making charity efforts more personable helps to improve trust in organisations where transparency might be difficult otherwise.</p> 
            <p>Users are also given feedback for the donation choices they make – that is positive donations offer praise while negative donations give reasoning for why certain provisions are not helpful to those on the receiving end.</p>

            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p>The experience prototype shows the role that Leap Motion Technologies have in facilitating a seamless interaction, accompanied by a full user journey map which demonstrates the full experience from beginning to end. </p>
