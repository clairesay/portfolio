                <h1>Collaborate to Donate<span class="date">JUNE '20</span></h1>
                <h3>Researcher | UX Designer | Product Designer</h3>
            </br>
            <i>In the User Experience Design Studio unit, my colleague Zeynep Canli and myself designed and prototyped a public experience, Collaborate to Donate. It aims to help donors understand how to make a productive impact in times of crisis while improving awareness of the value their contributions make in the lives of those facing recovery.</i>

            <h2>Brief</h2>
            <p>The devastating bushfire crisis of 2019 – 2020 was met with a compelling philanthropic effort, as Australians around the country donated what they had to support the recovery of victims. Though given with good intentions, charities were overwhelmed by many unsolicited donations which hampered, rather than helped the recovery effort.</p>
        </br>
            <p>Based on this situation, and for all recovery efforts in times of crises, IBM iX posed a question asking, <strong>“How can we empower citizens to make a productive impact in times of need from useful donations that don’t become a burden to our response teams?”</strong></p>
            
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>With such a broad brief, we conducted primary research to gain insight into both charity and donor perspectives for the situation at hand. This involved interviews with representatives from both community initiatives and charitable organisations, as well as sensitising and context mapping sessions with donors. A total of 11 participants took part in our research. </p>
        </br>
            <p>First up, we wrote a proper research plan to outline the direction we wanted to take. </p>
            <h3>Research Objective</h3>
            <p>Our objective outlined our aim and how we wanted to use this research in response to the upper level brief.</p>
        </br>
            <p class="quote">“We aim to understand what motivates members of the public to donate resources in times of crisis, as well as investigate what resources are needed by those impacted. From this, we hope to empower individuals to make a productive impact during these times of need.“</p>
            
            <h3>Research Questions</h3>
            <p>Breaking this objective down into questions helped us clarify targeted segments of information we hoped to understand.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What kind of resources are useful to people who have been affected by the bushfires?</li>
                    a. How are these genuine needs understood and communicated?
                <li>What does the public believe are appropriate donations to make to individuals in bushfire affected areas?</li>
                    a. Why is this perception established?
                <li>What motivates the public to make these donations? (main)</li>
                <li>What role do charities and NPOs (non for profit organisations) play in distributing goods during times of need?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Research Method</h3>
            <p>The goal of our research was to uncover underlying motivations and learn how to empower people to make an impactful difference for victims of crisis, such as natural disasters. To understand how charities perceived the impact of unsolicited donations systemically, we chose to conduct phone interviews.</p>
        </br>
            <p>However, conventional research techniques such as questionnaires and interviews would limit our ability to tap into the underlying rationale of donors. Generative research methods such as context-mapping was in turn chosen, to learn about donor insights as we needed a way of guiding participants to reflect, re-feel and tell stories about their experiences.</p>
            <h4>Context-mapping Sessions</h4>
            <p>A total of nine individuals who contributed physical goods or money towards bushfire recovery participated in a context-mapping. Prior to the session, we encouraged them to complete simple seven-day sensitising exercises, which we designed to stimulate thinking about their donation experiences in preparation for the context-mapping session. </p>
        </br>
            <p>During the session, we had prepared two activities – a Collage and Cognitive Map. </p>
        </br>
            <p>The collage consisted of a dual axis, with extremes such as ‘LIKE’ and ‘DISLIKE’, ‘PAST’ and ‘PRESENT’. Participants were handed small images of ambiguous nature and asked to paste them around the axes in reflection of their experiences. </p>
        </br>
            <p>The cognitive map aimed to capture the journey of the experience from ‘START’ to ‘END’. Participants pasted simple icons and annotated them with their emotions and decisions at every step of the way.</p>
        </br>
            <p>After completing both activities, we asked participants to explain what their creations represented and how they felt about their experiences. A facilitator, either myself or a research team member, would also ask questions to keep conversation flowing amongst participants.</p>
        </br>
            <p>The key to gathering insights during these sessions were to listen to the stories the participants had to tell, rather than the physical creations that they had made. We felt the sessions were highly successful due to the level of conversation attained.</p>
            
            <h4>Interviews</h4>
            <p>We also organised phone interviews with charity representatives to understand the systemic side of things. Our list of questions was semi-structured, meaning we had key questions to ask, but also the potential to follow a tangent if the interviewee provided an interesting insight. This gave us the ability to go beyond a participant’s surface-level response, tapping into underlying motivations and frustrations. </p>
        </br>
            <p>Two thirty-minute interviews were conducted – one with a representative of a charitable organisation, and one with a community club. Both were involved in collecting physical and monetary donations for victims in bushfire affected areas.</p>
            
            <h4>Collating the Data</h4>
            <p>We ended up with an enormous amount of qualitative data, all voicing a diverse range of concerns from both donors and organisations collecting those donations. To make sense of it all, we shared the task of collecting similar expressions and forming statement cards, each containing highlighted quotes from the interview and context mapping transcripts. Each card was also given a summarised interpretation, which we used to make upper level distinctions.</p>

            <h4>Research Visualisation</h4>
            <p>In order to make sense of our findings and share information with stakeholders, we developed a research visualisation which summarised the key insights. </p>
            <iframe class="ratio" src="public/images/collaborate/collaborate-research-visualisation.pdf" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
            <h2>Problem Space</h2>
        
            <p>From the research we had gathered, we found that donors were keen to support those in need, especially in times of crisis. However, many also expressed an underlying distrust for how charities handle donations, feeling their donations were not being used to support those most in need. </p>
        </br>
            <p>In line with these findings, we created a second brief that stated our focus area within the overarching brief provided by IBM iX. </p>
        </br>
            <p class="quote">"We strive to ensure that individuals contributing to recovery efforts for victims of natural disasters can donate physical and financial goods with the confidence that their contributions are being utilised to bring about impactful change to affected communities. Providing a sense of trust between donors and charities as well as facilitating effective communication between them will lift the haze of uncertainty clouding donor mindset hence empowering them to make a productive impact in times of need."</p>
            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>The brief called for an experience that carefully considered both digital and spatial elements. Through design sprints, we came up with dozens of one-line ideas but pursued four to elaborate into experience concepts. We then storyboarded scenarios of how we perceived each to pan out.</p>
        </br>
            <p>With a Pugh Selection Matrix, we rated our concepts based on a selection of highly relevant criteria. Then we whittled our options down to one, based on the matrix score as well as our judgement on how well it responded to the briefs. A part of the development process involved adding features we thought were important, taking some ideas from the discarded designs as well as removing superficial elements.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Overall, the experience we chose to refine is Collaborate to Donate. With Leap Motion Sensing technology, users freely engage in the interaction with natural hand gestures, dragging and dropping donation items into a collection box for a fictional victim persona. The addition of the persona attempts to enhance the connection with positive change that donors felt they lacked when they chose to donate. Making charity efforts more personable helps to improve trust in organisations where transparency might be difficult otherwise.</p> 
            <p>Users are also given feedback for the donation choices they make – that is positive donations offer praise while negative donations give reasoning for why certain provisions are not helpful to those on the receiving end.</p>

            <h2>Prototype</h2>
            <p>The experience prototype shows the role that Leap Motion Technologies have in facilitating a seamless interaction, accompanied by a full user journey map which demonstrates the full experience from beginning to end. </p>
