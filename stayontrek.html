            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Space travel has long intrigued humankind, and to date, outer space trips have been limited to scientific expeditions. However, growing interest from private companies, who are collaborating with government space travel initiatives, means space tourism and interplanetary travel is becoming more of a reality than ever before.</p>

            <p>This design brief hence prompts us to <strong>imagine the various interactive applications and systems within pre, mid and post-flight situations, which may be integral to the commercial space experience of the future.</strong></p>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>To set the scene for the brief, we outlined a fictional context looking 50 years in the future. Mankind has successfully settled and begun building infrastructure on Mars. Space tourism has gained traction and the first space cruise to the Mars settlement, will hold 100 passengers and crew on board. </p>
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <i>Each team member was assigned a unique research area to explore, but shared an identical research plan for consistency.</i>
            <p>When prompted with the notion of commercial spaceflight, the first thing our minds turned to was the imminent risk. Emergency situations on Earth can be catastrophic without the correct preventative measures in place, so what more in an unfamiliar and isolated environment?</p>

            
            </p>
            <h3>Research Objective</h3>
            <p>For consistency across our research, we shared an overarching objective:</p>

        <mark><q>To understand how emergency situations occur and can be addressed amid a spaceflight, to inform how we can better prepare and educate crew and passengers for safe and secure space travel.</q></mark>
            <h3>Research Areas</h3>
            <p>Within this problem space, our team identified two key stakeholders â€“ passengers and crew members. <strong>During an emergency, the behaviours, motivations and frustrations differ for each group</strong>, revealing a diverse range of problem areas to explore.</p>
            <p>Additionally, emergency responses can be characterised by <strong>both pre-flight education and mid-flight communications</strong>. </p>

            <!-- <p><strong>Passenger Emergency Communications</strong></p> -->
            <h3>Research Methods</h3>
            <p>Unlike any present day design problem, this brief called for the prediction of potential needs in a speculative world, existing far in the future. <strong>The bulk of our research centred around existing contexts similar to that of space travel,</strong> including everything from campuses to air travel, and mission-based spaceflight.</p>
            <h4>Background Research</h4>
            <p>To kick off, we conducted some background research of existing documentation and precedents. These studies were supplemented with a competitors analysis of existing solutions, and an online ethnography, where we harvested user content surrounding emergency experiences. <strong>The findings helped build foundational awareness and expectations for the problem space.</strong></p>
            <!-- <h4>Online Ethnography</h4>
            <p>Due to the spontaneous and practically impossible to observe nature of emergency situations, we turned to online sources and harvested user content surrounding experiences with emergency situations. This content was in the form of comments, images, videos, blogs, etc, addressing the relevant problem spaces.</p> -->
            <h4>Interviews</h4>
            <p>To supplement these background studies, we also conducted remote, semi-structured interviews with relevant participants.</p>
            <p>Four individuals were considered to be <strong>crew members</strong>, who have participated in emergency response training and hold responsibility over their respective occupants if an emergency were to occur. </p>
            <p>Four individuals were interviewed as <strong>'ordinary' occupants</strong> who have experienced true emergencies or drills in various contexts, typically within a public space.</p>
            <p><strong>We tailored interview questions for each group of participants, and probed further when interesting points were raised.</strong></p>

            <p>Having explored four distinct facets of the problem space, we came out of this phase with a vast number of insights about the context, and potential users. The following highlight some key issues. </p>

            <h3>First Design Decisions</h3>
            <p>To supplement our decision making, we compared solutions within the specific problem area which they address, compiling scores in a Pugh Matrix. 
            <figure>

                <figcaption class="for-image">Pugh Matrices for decision making</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p><strong>We decided on solutions that not only satisfied the criteria, but could add value for our users</strong>, which led to us pursuing a total of four concepts â€“ the most relevant one for each problem space.</p>
            <p>With these concepts ready to go, we discussed ideas as we worked, visually telling through further annotated sketches. <strong>We used these sketches as artefacts in our first round of evaluations</strong>, asking potential users for their opinions regarding the concepts. This session allowed us to get on the same wavelength as our users and understand their initial perceptions.</p>

            <p>Some key issues with our designs that had emerged during user evaluations were underlying problems that we had overlooked, such as that holding one's arm up to use a smartwatch as a communication device would be tiring and cause discomfort. <strong>Early testing with users was highly beneficial for pointing out blindspots before we pursued a design</strong>.</p> 

          
            <h2>Low Fidelity</h2>
            <p>Based on this feedback from potential users, we were able to address any issues raised, before creating lo-fi Balsamiq wireframes for a minimum viable experience.</p>

             <h4>Low Fidelity Usability Testing</h4>
            <p><strong>To evaluate the usability of these concepts, we conducted one round of usability testing with five potential users</strong>. For each concept, we outlined a set of tasks, which participants would perform as they interacted with the low-fidelity prototype. We requested that they <strong>think aloud while performing tasks, so we could understand their thought process</strong>.</p>
            <p>All our concepts were flawed, and this round of evaluations inspired a number of structural improvements. We ended the low-fidelity iterations with journey maps to summarise the proposed concepts.</p>

            <h2>High Fidelity</h2>
            <p>Despite all four design solutions being viable and worth pursuing, turning them all into high-fidelity designs would be a time and resource intensive move. <strong>Making justified design decisions early is a vital step towards achieving a tangible solution</strong>. 
            For this very reason, our team opted to conduct persona-based walkthroughs and a heuristics evaluation to objectively decide which idea to continue with. </p>

These qualitative responses were coupled with the findings of a <strong>heuristic evaluations, which determined design violations</strong>.</p> -->

                <p>Based on evaluation outcomes, we came to the decision to pursue Stay on Trek as our final concept, turning the wireframes into high-fidelity prototypes in Figma for the mobile application, and Unity for the HoloLens simulation. </p>

            <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
            <h3>It always seems impossible until itâ€™s done</h3>
            <p>This project appeared insurmountable at the very beginning, and in the time period given to complete each step, it seemed as though it would be impossible to achieve a phenomenal outcome. However, this project taught me the importance of breaking big goals into little steps, setting milestones for each team member to meet a deadline in time. The end result that we finished with blew our own expectations out of the water.</p>
